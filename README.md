Some like to call me @El-Raphael. \n
Maybe in the middle of a street-fight or eating pizzas, my secrets passions are computers and books. \n
Currently in the middle of reading Python and algorithms for dummies. \n
I'm looking to work on projects that I like the most and with people trying to make a better world with the help of TeChNoLoGy. \n
You can contact me through Discord = [soon] or Skype = [not yet]
