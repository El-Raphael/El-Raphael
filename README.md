Some like to call me @El-Raphael.
Maybe in the middle of a street-fight or eating pizzas, my secrets passions are computers and books.
Currently in the middle of reading Python and algorithms for dummies.
I'm looking to work on projects that I like the most and with people trying to make a better world with the help of Technology
You can contact me through Discord = [soon] or Skype = [not yet]
